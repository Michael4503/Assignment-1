# Assignment 1

To use my node module is similar to Lab2 where I created an app.js to console.log the results of my functions.
I call my functions using the dot notation methods

Function #1: addStudent
Registers a new student into the students array. The parameters are the name, adminNo and email.

Function #2: addAssignment
Creates a new assignment for students in the assignments array. The parameters are the title, assignmentID and description.

Function #3: submitAssignment
Simulates a student submitting their assignment. The parameters are the adminNo and assignmentID.

Function #4: gradeAssignment
Grades a student submission. The parameters adminNo, assignmentID and grade

Function #5: retrieveStudentsByGrade
Retrieves student info based on a specific grade. Parameter is grade.
